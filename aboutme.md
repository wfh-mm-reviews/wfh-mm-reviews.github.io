### My story

I became a work from home mom since the beginning of 2021. It has been wonderful and challenging at the same time. 

As I start to get the hang of juggling work and baby-care, I realize how much the internet has helped me in making wise and informed purchases, as I always consult internet reviews before placing an order. 

I hope to be able to share my lessons, and offer honest reviews on the many products that attempt to make parenting life easier. Spoiler Alert: Some products are pointless splurges whilst some others are quite the lifesaver!
